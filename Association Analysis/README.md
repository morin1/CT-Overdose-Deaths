# Association or Market basket analysis - online transactions

Association analysis (most commonly known as "Market Basket Analysis") is a type of unsupervised analysis that seeks to find hidden patterns or connections in data through identifying instances of co-occurrence. The meaning of co-ocurrence can be explained in regards to customer shopping behavior where we ask the question "given the occurrence of product A (the antecedent) in a transaction, how likely are we to find the occurrence of product B (the consequent)?"(Provost & Fawcett,2013). An example could be the co-occurrence of cereal and milk in a hypothetical grocery store transaction. This can also include groups of more than one item (e.g., the occurrence of peanut butter and jelly in a transaction, may lead to the purchase of bread (Lantz,015)).

For this notebook, I will be exploring 'Association' analysis in regards to online customer transactions, to learn patterns in the purchasing data. This knowledge from mining patterns in customer shopping behavior can then be leveraged in many ways: to make better product recommendations, create cross-selling opportunities (placing items next to each other in an aisle), better inform marketing decisions, and even inform the logistics of warehousing inventory.
