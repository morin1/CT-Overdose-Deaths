# Connecticut accidental overdose deaths
### Exploring the "Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012_2018" dataset

For this project, I utilized publicly available state data regarding accidental drug overdose deaths to help better understand the overdose crisis. The state data I am working with was gathered from www.data.ct.gov and captures all accidental overdose deaths that occurred in the state between the years of 2012 to 2018. The “Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018” is a single dataset that contains 5106 observations and 41 columns and is a listing of all deaths associated with drug overdoses that occurred in Connecticut over a 7-year period (from 2012 to 2018). This dataset contains time series data, demographic data (Age, Sex, Race), any/all type of drugs involved in the deaths, corresponding geographic data (place of death, place of residence, latitude and longitude), as well as description of injury and official Cause of Death for each observation (https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Accidental-Drug-Related-Deaths-2012-2018/rybz-nyjw).

I have also gathered other data to help fill in the gaps of the main data source regarding county/city:
  Dataset on all CT cities and corresponding counties info: https://ctstatelibrary.org/cttowns/counties
  2010 CT Population Data Town & County: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-Town-and-County-Population-for-Connecticut
  
Along with the cleaning file and EDA using a Jupyter notebook, I have also produced an Excel dashboard of the cleaned and transformed data.
