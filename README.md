# Data-Science-Projects
This is a collection of some of my work that I have completed using data science and analytics; whether for work, school, or on my own as a way to learn. 

Feel free to contact me at morin.jeff@gmail.com regarding any meaningful data science or analytics opportunities. I am also interested in working with non-profits in a pro bono capacity.
