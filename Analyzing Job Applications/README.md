# What's the most popular time to apply for a job?
For a busy Talent Acquisition team, the more you can understand your applicant pool, the more effective you will be. Better understanding your applicants allows you to optimize your talent pipeline, getting the most out of your sourcing dollars and delivering the best outcomes for your business. 

When are they typically job searching?<br> 
Are there certain days of the week or times of day when they are most active?

I processed data from over 15,000 hourly job applicants in foodservice and manufacturing from across the country in states such as California, Illinois and Georgia, from 2018 to 2020, to better understand when the applicants are submitting their applications. Looking at 2019 specifically, which yielded over 12 thousand initiated applications, I segmented the job search by week, day, and hour to get a sense of the general behavior of applicants to find out what were the most popular days and times for initiating the application process.

To get a more representative sense of popularity during a given hour of the week for 2019, I calculated each hourâ€™s proportional share of total applications for the entire week. In other words, to get the best idea of generally how popular 9am Thursday morning was for 2019, I calculated the median of all of 2019's Thursday 9am application volumes.

This project is based off of analytics work I previously performed which resulted in this blog post (https://www.stellaremploy.com/case-studies-1/2020/5/12/grow-your-hourly-talent-pipeline-with-these-tips)

The dataset attributes are: application_id, start_date, completion_date, city. The data used for this project has been modified (anonymized, with randomly generated IDs added) to remove any personally identifying information.
